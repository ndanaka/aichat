## Config

On first launch, aichat will guide you through configuration.

```
> No config file, create a new one? Yes
> Openai API Key: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
> Use proxy? Yes
> Set proxy: socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
> Save chat messages Yes
```

After setting, it will automatically create the configuration file. Of course, you can also manually set the configuration file. 

```yaml
api_key: "<YOUR SECRET API KEY>"        # Request via https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
temperature: 1.0                        # optional, see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-temperature
save: true                              # optional, If set to true, aichat will save chat messages to message.md
no_highlight: false                     # optional, Whether to disable highlight
proxy: "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"        # optional, set proxy server. e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080 or socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

Use `.info` command to view the configuration file path.
```
ã€‰.info
config file         /home/alice/.config/aichat/config.yaml
roles file          /home/alice/.config/aichat/roles.yaml
messages file       /home/alice/.config/aichat/messages.md
current role        
proxy               
save messages       true
highlight           true
```

### Roles

We can let ChatGPT play a certain role through `prompt` to make it better generate what we want. See [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) for details.

We can predefine a batch of roles in `roles.yaml`. For example, we define a emoji translator as follows.

```yaml
- name: emoji
  prompt: >
    I want you to translate the sentences I wrote into emojis. I will write the sentence, and you will express it with emojis.
    I just want you to express it with emojis. I don't want you to reply with anything but emoji.
    When I need to tell you something in English, I will do it by wrapping it in curly brackets like {like this}.
    My first sentence is:
```

Let ChatGPT answer questions in the role of a emoji translator

```
$ aichat --role emoji I am very angry
ðŸ˜ ðŸ’¢ðŸ‘¿
```

In interactive chat, we do this:

```
ã€‰.role emoji

ã€‰I am very angry
```
